# My Robocode

This is just a repository of my robots for Robocode. 
Robocode is a programming game, where the goal is to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks in Java or .NET. The robot battles are running in real-time and on-screen.

Checkout the RoboWiki page for more information on how to play and set up the game.
